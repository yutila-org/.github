# Software Design Document Template
> [!Important]
> All designs and implementations must strictly adhere to the [Yutila Security Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqEZ9wyOiUj6hyH294iyZh9IXi8PnqnQC8UB7tnc0I0/edit?usp=sharing). Verify that your proposal incorporates the core architectural principles (Fail-Safe Defaults, Least Privilege, and Open Design) before submitting for review.

## 1. Design Diagram Overview
<!-- Provide a direct hyperlink to the finalized initial version of the system's design diagram. This visual representation should illustrate the major components, their interactions, and the overall system architecture. -->

**Diagram Link:** [Insert URL to the external design diagram here]

## 2. Problems to be Solved
<!-- List all specific problems, challenges, or requirements this design aims to address. Each problem must correspond to one or more solutions detailed in Section 3. -->

### Problem: [Name of the problem]
-   **Statement:** [Clearly define the problem, including the context in which it occurs and why a new solution is necessary.]
-   **Solutions:** [Link to all the proposed solutions for this problem that are included in the same document.]

## 3. Proposed Solutions
<!-- Detail the proposed solutions for the problems identified in Section 2. Each solution should clearly reference the problem(s) it addresses and will be linked to specific implementation tasks in Section 4. -->

### Solution: [Name of the solution]
-   **Statement:** [Clearly define the solution.]
-   **Security & Privacy:** [Define how this solution adheres to the Security Policies if applicable (e.g., encryption at rest, least privilege).]
-   **Implementations:** [Link to all the proposed implementations for this solution that are included in the same document.]

## 4. Implementation Details
<!-- Outline the detailed plan for implementing each proposed solution, including technical specifications, affected components, and required steps. -->

### Implementation: [Name of the implementation]
-   **Security & Privacy:** [Specify the exact security controls (e.g., TLS 1.3, Ed25519 signatures) or privacy safeguards (e.g., PII anonymization) for this component if applicable.]
-   **Verification:** [Link to all the proposed tests for this implementation that are included in the same document.]

**Description:** [Detailed description of the proposed implementation for the solution.]

```
// Insert technical specifications or target implementation code here
```

## 5\. Testing and Validation

<!-- Define the success criteria for the design. Every implementation must pass these verification gates before merging into main. -->

### Test: [Name of the test]

**Description:** [Detailed description of the proposed test for the implementation.]

```
// Insert verification logic, assertions, or test suite integration here
```

## 6\. Next Steps and Review

The implementation phase will commence after the final review and approval of this design document.

Following approval, a Trello issue tracker board will be provisioned to orchestrate development. To verify your active project assignments, check the issue tracker platform for the specific boards you have been granted access to or the code repository platform to see what projects you’ve been assigned to.
